# Space Game 101

A bare-bones arcade game written in vanilla JavaScript (ES6+) for learning purposes.

> **WORK IN PROGRESS**

I started this as a fun way to learn about the new features in EcmaScript version 6 and beyond, especially native Classes and modules.

Hopefully I'll add a write-up or tutorial here at some point.

## Milestones

- [v0.2](https://github.com/hvianna/space-game-101/releases/tag/v0.2) - Playable game with working score, player death and one indestructible enemy.
- [v0.1](https://github.com/hvianna/space-game-101/releases/tag/v0.1) - Implements basic game structure and working "attract mode" (not playable).
